# I am an Athlete

### Mostly Beach Volleyball
Formerly ranked top #400 in the country, graduate school and injuries set me back prety hard.

### Animal Flow
Easily my favorite workouts ever - bear crawls, bunny hops, crab walks - move like an animal & put it all together! It was such a shame when I hurt myself doing them last year. Excited to get back.

### Yoga
I like yin, where you lie on the ground and breathe your way into different states. I mostly did vinyasa in graduate school. Got pretty good, a lot of that strength is easy to recover. Remember to press into the inside of your hands!

### Bad at Pickleball
Beach Volleyball translates well. It's fun to whack stuff with a paddle. Maybe I should have stuck with tennis...

### Worse at Rock Climbing
Tried it, bad at it, love it, arms look huge after! Got hurt (unrelated), had to stop.

### Used to be Good (ish) at Rowing
I rowed for 1 semester in graduate school. I did one timed erg 2K with 1:42 splits @ 30 strokes per minute. Could not walk pain-free the rest of the weekend ðŸ˜… Quit to go back to volleyball the following semester.
