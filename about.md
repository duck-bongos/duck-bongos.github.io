# Welcome
Hi! My name is Dan. I like striving for _magis_, or "more" excellence in my life, particularly around cognitive curiosities, athletic goals, and relationships with people. Feel free to poke around, read more, or send me an email.

If you're a recruiter interested in hiring me, please navigate to the Professional section, find the Easter Egg, pull my resume for your own purposes, and send me a message through the instructions there. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this! I certainly had fun making it.


# Where I'm From
### Origin Point
[![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cincinnati.jpeg "Cincinnat, OH")](https://www.visittheusa.com/destination/cincinnati){:target="_blank"}
I grew up in Cincinati Ohio, easily the best part of Ohio and one of the most overlooked regions in the country. I enrolled in the University of Cincinnati's Lindner School of Business [Honors PLUS program](https://business.uc.edu/student-experience/lindner-business-honors.html). The program has changed a lot in the decade-plus since I enrolled in it, but its commitment to holistically educating students to the highest level stands firm.

With a small cohort of ~25 students, I -
- Completed 2 full years of internships,
- Visited Washington, D.C. and New York, NY for business and regulatory body meetings.
- Took a 6 week trip to Europe to do the same, stopping in London England, Brussels Belgium, Munich Germany, Milan Italy, Riga Latvia, and Geneva Switzerland. I also went to Venice, Lake Como, Prague, Istanbul, Barcelona, and Paris on my way home.
- Played and led the nationally ranked club volleyball team, becoming the President in 2015-16 after being treasuerer in 2013-14.
- Academically and professionally (I promise I went to most classes), learned I really enjoy working on data problems and programming.

It was an incredible blessing.

### The Ship Leaves the Harbor

After graduating, I started working as a Data Engineer at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) in Princeton, New Jersey. The years were filled with mainly two things - writing progressively better `Python` code and playing tons of beach volleyball. I remained at Bloomberg for 2 days shy of 4 years, leaving to go enjoy the 2 months of summer before starting graduate school in the fall.

### The Storm

[![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sbu.jpg "Stony Brook University")](https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/the-year-that-was-stony-brook-university-2023-in-photos/){:target="_blank"}

I arrived at Stony Brook University with a lot of confidence in my abilities. I left with more, as a result of trial by fire. Graduate school was a very difficult time for me. Academically - I was unprepared. Holy shit was I unprepared. Professional programming in `Python` did not prepare me for the theory behind everything I was doing. My undergraduate degre in business certainly didn't either. My first semester I took 4 classes - don't do that. 

### Break In the Clouds

[![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/boston.jpg "Boston, MA")](https://www.timeout.com/boston/things-to-do/best-things-to-do-in-the-summer-in-boston){:target="_blank"}

I took an internship at a startup called [VideaHealth](https://www.videa.ai/) based in Boston. Because of my punitive lease, I didn't move there and worked remote, traveling up twice. The company was awesome because it completely changed how I looked at writing code. Where at Bloomberg I had to ensure every line was unit tested and typehinted, in a start up those things can fall to the wayside because you're moving at a breakneck pace. It was my first education in professional prioritization under duress.

### Back to the Storm
I finally got the chance to take a computer vision class, what I thought I wanted for 2 years. It was cool but ultimately was disappointed, especially by the enforcement of academic honesty. Then I learned my topic of choice was either PhD-big or not a good idea. So I decided it'd be best to get out ASAP. Did my thesis with computational geometry and discrete mathematic icon [David Gu](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~gu/). After graduation, I struggled to land a job in the worst job market for computer scientists in years. Compared to 2019, where the word "Python" on your resume would get you an offer for $150K (hyperbole)
