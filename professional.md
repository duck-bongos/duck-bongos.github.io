# Professional Experience
A brief history. It reads most recent to oldest in a much more anecdotal way about feelings - cool things that happened, tough people to work with, lessons learned. It's almost like a journal.

## Rewriting the Rewritten System
Ongoing... stay tuned.

## RAG Developer for a Day
Figured out how to query OpenAI 30K times/hour then turn it into a pip-installable package for all our developers. I really enjoyed taking a Proof-of-Concept to production and making it reusable & configurable. Got to fix many of my mistakes in V2, which was so much better, then it got left on the shelf because CVS didn't want to use it. Became competent at `asyncio`, reusable design, and `importlib`.

## Rewriting Existing System
They already had a system in place. It was hacked together pretty badly. I hacked a new version together differently. Lesson learned, when everyone is telling you to speed up, take some time to pick your head up and explore solutions. I also learned Databricks was going to be my enemy. 7 layers of environments, 2 of which attach to Spark - my god. I don't know Docker but your clusterf*** (they use clusters - get it?) made me start to learn it.

Interning again! My seventh internship experience. Seven. I spent two and one-third years as an intern. Give me a job already! Goodness.

I went back to graduate school and had a very tough time. I was a graduate assistant for an undergraduate data science class, so technically I worked here! I was also a ‚àöirtual code coach for kids. Doing all that was not easy.

Played a loooooot of beach volleyball. Made about $400. Find more under Athletics!

### Purgatory _(February 2021-June 2021)_
Honest to all deities ever - I don't remember a single thing I did here besides grieve the loss of my awesome team. Whatever I did didn't matter.

### The Koality Koalas  _(June 2019 ~ January 2021)_

### First taste of Data Science  _(May 2018 ~ June 2019)_

### "The Workflow Team"    _(June 2017 ~ April 2018)_
God, what a time to forget. JIRA, groovy - FML.

Mostly realized I think tech is cool and want to stay in it. Absolutely devastated by the rejection from the ITLP program or whatever it was called. I was told it was because I was too interested in becoming a direct data science hire and was wishy-washy about it. Lesson learned - when you're a cool-looking peg, don't work for leadership training programs.

##### Summer 2016
Cybersecurity. Didn't learn a thing about the field. Learned heavily that I struggle when bored.

##### Spring 2016
Absolutely crushed it. Told my first team that they needed an internal vendor to build the solution they need, not 3 months of a woefully underqualified intern's weak effort. Then went to a second team that taught me the bigger the company, the bigger the bureaucracy.

##### Summer 2015
People care way less about if you're on the coolest team if you don't do anything for them. Learned about soliciting timely feedback.

##### Fall 2014
Whoa. Code is cool. And hard. What am I doing again? Yikes I'm over my head. Hello World!

In the mostly-frozen spring semester of 2014 I wrote thousands of lines of excel `IF` statements. So many, that I started thinking "there must be a better way". Then I learned about computer programming from here! I guess Ferno is my origin story? ü§î _"Once upon a time a frustrated intern wanted to automate Microsoft Excel. 10 years later he has a Master's in Computer Science"_.

# Paycor <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/work_logos/PaycorLogo_v2.jpg" style="float: left; width:50px; height:50px; display: block; margin-right:10px " >
My first job! Top pick for company, let down by experience / learned what I like and don't. I was hired as a freshman Sales intern for [Paycor](https://www.paycor.com/). I was not good at it. Cold calling people may be my worst skill. The one thing I liked was a project around customer data in my last 3 weeks. Wheels began to turn ‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è
