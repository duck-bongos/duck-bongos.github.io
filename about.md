Hi! My name is Dan. I like striving for _magis_, or "more" excellence in my life, particularly around cognitive curiosities, athletic goals, and relationships with people. Feel free to poke around, read more, or send me an email.

If you're a recruiter interested in hiring me, please navigate to the Professional section, find the Easter Egg, and send me a message through the instructions there. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this! I certainly had fun making it.

Shout out to [Ben Centra][bencentra] for putting this [Jekyll][jekyll] [theme together][centrarium] for my website.
