# Duck Bongos Origins
I wanted a GitHub username that was memorable, amusing, and had initials that matched my own, `DB`. Database seemed overused in the tech community, so I combined animals and music. I thought it'd be funny to watch a duck play bongos. Still do. That's it.

As for this "blog" - I'm not sure I'm going to use it. I have things I could write for myself. TBD. This is a good starting and stopping point for now.
