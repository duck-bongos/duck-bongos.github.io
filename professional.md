# [Professional Experience]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}
I feel fortunate for the breadth of companies I've worked for so far. This page serves as a brief history. It reads newest to oldest in a much more anecdotal way, focusing on feelings - cool things that happened, tough lessons learned, and checkpoints in life. It's almost like a journal.

#### Rewriting the Rewritten System
**(Mar 2025 - )** We're figuring out what we _want_ to do... stay tuned. I'm very excited for this because I feel on the cusp of serious engineering growth. Azure feels like it should have all the pieces in place to build a robust system, I'm not sure what that solution space is yet.

#### RAG Developer for a Day
**(Aug 2024 - Feb 2025)** Figured out how to query OpenAI 30K times/hour then turn it into a pip-installable package for all our developers. I really enjoyed taking a proof-of-concept to production and making it reusable & configurable. Got to fix many of my mistakes in V2, which was so much better, then it got left on the shelf because CVS's ML team didn't want to use it ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

 I'm a better programmer for it. Became competent at `asyncio`, reusable design, and `importlib`. It was my first somewhat successful attempt at dependency injection! Pretty proud of that.

#### Rewriting Existing Machine Learning System
**(Oct 2023 - Aug 2024)** I spent much of this time re-writing the existing system (technically twice) to make it more modular. I did not ask enough questions about the way we _should_ be doing things and shoehorned a new implementation into a current design. In graduate school, I discovered that when I re-allocate my time from 80-90% writing code and 10-20% reading documentation to 70-80% reading documentation and techniques, still takes the same amount of total time to complete because I have a much clearer idea of what I'm doing.

I didn't do that. I tried to finish it as quickly as possible.

Exploring alternative solutions is worth at least a few hours, especially when you're new to the company or team. I also learned Databricks, particularly its notebook implementation, was going to be my enemy. 7 layers of environments, 2 of which attach to Spark in order to interface with the rest of the ecosystem does not make for easily repeatable coding. I didn't know Docker but their clusterf***s (they use clusters - get it?) made me start to learn it. 

On balance, I think their MLFlow integration is top notch and their data availability is incredibly strong.

**(Aug 2021 - May 2023)** I went back to graduate school and had a very tough time. I was a graduate assistant for an undergraduate data science class, so technically I worked here! I was also a ‚àöirtual code coach for kids. Doing all that was not easy.

### <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/work_logos/summer.jpeg" style="float: left; width:50px; height:50px; display: block; margin-right:10px " > Intentionally Unemployed 
**(Jun 2021 - Aug 2021)** Played a loooooot of beach volleyball earning about $400. Find more under Athletics!

### <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/work_logos/bloomberg.png" style="float: left; width:50px; height:50px; display: block; margin-right:10px " > Bloomberg LP 
**(Jun 2017 - Jun 2021)**

#### Limbo
**(February 2021-June 2021)**
Honest to all deities ever - I don't remember a single thing I did here besides grieve the loss of my awesome team. Whatever I did didn't matter to me, or to them.

#### The Koality Koalas
**(June 2019 ~ January 2021)** Easily the best team I've been on to date. One senior engineering manager, one senior data engineer, me, and 3 other 20-somethings got thrown together. The manager pulled me into his project of tracking anomalous data points across datasets. One developer and I hit it off immediately, earning the nickname "Critical Mass" by  our manager after the nuclear physics trait where one extra atom will set off a whole reaction. In our case, that "reaction" was a never-ending conversation about non-work topics. It got so bad (good üòà) our strong-but-silent senior data engineer started joining in coversations. To date, this is the strongest indicator of my style of technical leadership - the more comfortable your team is around you, the better they perform. I will go out of my way to make people comfortable.

And we did - other teams in Tech Ops asked us how we did it. Credit to my manager, he got the right people and got out of our way. Management started getting in his way in summer 2020 and by August he'd had enough and switched teams. The team effectively ran itself for another 4 months, though we lost 2 more engineers. The killer blow when our project manager (who we converted to a data engineer because they were such a sharp programmer) elected to leave, and they dissolved the team.

#### First taste of Data Science
**(May 2018 ~ June 2019)** I was put on a long-term project to classify documents for our Municipal Bond data team. This was likely the most important project of my career because it marked a turning point where I had to learn a lot of technology very quickly or fail at the thing I (then) wanted. The data science team I worked with was based in London UK which made collaboration difficult. The stakeholders were not technically savvy and often contradicted their requirements months after when I followed up. 

As a result of this experience, I got significantly better at Python, building real-world ML systems, understanding NLP, project management, and stakeholder management. People is what makes computers so hard.

I also learned that being isolated is not a good environment for me. I was more abrasive to my colleagues asking for help. For that, I'm sincerely sorry.

#### "The Workflow Team"
**(June 2017 ~ April 2018)**
God, what a time to forget. JIRA, groovy - FML.

# Internships!
I did 6 in undergraduate. They were a long time ago. I learned a lot about the types of things I like and the types of people I thrive around.

#### <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/work_logos/GE-Aviation-Logo.jpg" style="float: left; width:50px; height:50px; display: block; margin-right:10px " >  GE Aviation  
Mostly realized I think tech is cool and want to stay in it. Absolutely devastated by the rejection from the ITLP program or whatever it was called. I was told it was because I was too interested in becoming a direct data science hire and was wishy-washy about it. Lesson learned - when you're a cool-looking peg, don't work for leadership training programs.

##### Summer 2016
Cybersecurity. Didn't learn a thing about the field besides how to distinguish between a private and public subnet. Learned a very hard imporant lesson that my priorities are often not aligned with other people's.

##### Spring 2016
Absolutely crushed it. Told my first team that they needed an internal vendor to build the solution they need, not 3 months of a woefully underqualified intern's weak effort. Then went to a second team that taught me the bigger the company, the bigger the bureaucracy. Learned about something called "Talend", I think? I attempted to start learning Java. Figured out that in some companies, confidence is more important than competence. I prefer competence for myself.

##### Summer 2015
People care way less about if you're on the coolest team if you don't do anything for them. Learned about soliciting timely feedback.

##### Fall 2014
Whoa. Code is cool. And hard. What am I doing again? Yikes I'm over my head. Hello World!

#### <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/work_logos/ferno_logo.png" style="float: left; width:50px; height:50px; display: block; margin-right:10px " > Ferno Washington 
In the mostly-frozen spring semester of 2014 I wrote thousands of lines of excel `IF` statements. So many, that I started thinking "there must be a better way". Then I learned about computer programming from here! I guess Ferno is my origin story? ü§î _"Once upon a time a frustrated intern wanted to automate Microsoft Excel. 10 years later he has a Master's in Computer Science"_.

#### <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/work_logos/PaycorLogo_v2.jpg" style="float: left; width:50px; height:50px; display: block; margin-right:10px " > Paycor 
My first job! Top pick for company, let down by experience / learned what I like and don't. I was hired as a freshman Sales intern for [Paycor](https://www.paycor.com/). I was not good at it. Cold calling people may be my worst skill. The one thing I liked was a project around customer data in my last 3 weeks. Wheels began to turn ‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è
