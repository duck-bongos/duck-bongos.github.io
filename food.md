### Thai Cuisine

I asked for a Thai cookbook for Christmas one year. I enjoy creating my own paste from scratch (pictured).

### Mexican
If you don't like tacos, go away. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Horchata, especially from [Tacos Por Favor](https://www.tacosporfavor.us/) in Santa Monica. I'd pay $300 to drink a gallon of theirs. It's part of my last meal.

These are the 20 tacos I ate in 14 minutes 46 seconds to earn a t-shirt.

### Argentinian

Nobody makes steaks like an Argentinian. And if they do, it's 10X as expensive. The best meal of my life was at [La Cabrera in Buenos Aires](https://www.lacabrera.com.ar/). If you order the 0.6 kG steak (pictured), please know that's ~1.2 lbs imperial. We did not do the math correctly, and yet that didn't stop us from finishing the steak.


### Barbecue

Has a special place in my heart. For those of you that know why - hi ü§ó I'm fortunate to have tried Michelin-star barbecue in Austin at [La Barbecue](https://www.labarbecue.com/). All this cost about $100 (for 2 people) and we waited in line for an hour. 

### [Wild Game](https://www.fossilfarms.com/)
This is not so much a cuisine as an ingredient sourcing spot! While living in NJ, I listened to some podcast ages ago that made me reconsider the source of my protein. Factory farming to me feels eerily similar to the scenes from The Matrix series where the machines are harvesting people. I came across game meat as a healthier alternative and [Fossil Farms](https://www.fossilfarms.com/pages/about-us) as a supplier. I wish they'd sponsor me. the primary reason I want to earn more money is to eat exclusively game meat-based dishes. Swap in bison for beef, wild boar for pork, and duck for chicken (ok this one is a stretch). Essentially, keep all the same cuisine you normally cook with, it's going to taste similar, except it's going to be leaner.

I've even gone so far as to cook Bison Brisket for Christmas dinner (Fossil Farms, seriously, sponsor me please).


### Hot Sauce
I've always liked spicy food. There was something about proving you could do somthing other people wouldn't that just _appealed_. That morphed into me actually enjoying certain flavors that you can only access at certain spice levels. Authentic Thai and Indonesian cuisine can be quite spicy. For example:

[Butterfly Bakery's Hot House Hot Sauce](https://butterflybakeryvt.com/products/hot-house-hot-sauce)
> _This blazingly delightful sauce features the best the garden has to offer. Cilantro and dill balance perfectly with tomatoes and our unique five pepper blend to create this surprisingly versatile sauce.  It tastes fantastic on grilled cheese, tapenade, and fish_.

It really does taste heavily of cilantro and dill in a tantalizingly cooling way that briefly makes you forget you're about to get slapped with heat.

[Djablo Original Sauce](https://djablosauce.com/products/original-djablo-5oz)
> Bright and zesty, perfect for breakfast sandwiches and tacos, adding a refreshing kick to any dish.

If you want a hot sauce that balances ginger and garlic perfectly at the forefront of flavor, this is your sauce. I've bought it twice, it never lasts more than a week. 

[Onima Il Mig](https://onimapantry.com/collections/shop/products/il-mig)
> Featured on Season 24 of Hot Ones, IL MIG+ Hot Sauce brings savory, umami-rich heat straight out of Spain. Perfect for those who want to add complex flavors to their meals.

This might be my favorite hot sauce ever. It's the most mesmerizing flavor combination of smooth texture and rich flavors. It took 1st at the 2025 Scovie Awards for the [All-Natural Hot](https://www.scovieawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025ScovieWinnersDirectory2.pdf) category.

Before you ask, yes, I'm a huge fan of the YouTube show Hot Ones and have done the hot ones challenge three times! I have 18 oz of [The Last Dab - Apollo](https://hotones.com/products/the-last-dab-apollo-hot-ones-hot-sauce?variant=53527939449123&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=us_all_pmax_ua_hotones_20250515_hotones-bau_purchases&utm_content=&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22559447974&gbraid=0AAAAA_e8N02FSmns83BFHfFe1z6ZiCaMD&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VMZey7eetFkikKnhjSbe6sMfQTXLmOFznsv1eWSQyu7dM94bINPuwRoCgZkQAvD_BwE) in my fridge right now. If anyone has any recipes where I could use this PLEASE reach out.
