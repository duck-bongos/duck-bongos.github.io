### Thai Cuisine
I asked for a Thai cookbook for Christmas one year. I enjoy creating my own paste from scratch.

### Mexican
If you don't like tacos, go away. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Horchata, especially from [Tacos Por Favor](https://www.tacosporfavor.us/) in Santa Monica. I'd pay $300 to drink a gallon of theirs. It's part of my last meal.

These are the 20 tacos I ate in 14 minutes 46 seconds to earn a t-shirt.

### Argentine
Nobody makes steaks like an Argentinian. And if they do, it's 10X as expensive. The best meal of my life was at [La Cabrera in Buenos Aires](https://www.lacabrera.com.ar/). If you order the 0.6 kG steak, please know that's ~1.2 lbs imperial. We did not do the math correctly, and yet that didn't stop us from finishing the steak.

### Barbecue
Has a special place in my heart. For those of you that know why - hi ü§ó I'm fortunate to have tried Michelin-star barbecue in Austin at [La Barbecue](https://www.labarbecue.com/). All this cost about $100 (for 2 people) and we waited in line for an hour.
